User Stories
Based on the use case diagram, I’ll select the following core use cases to convert into user stories: User Registration, Book Property, Make Payment, Leave Review, and Manage System. These cover key interactions across Guest, Host, and Admin roles.

User Registration:
User Story: As a new user, I want to register an account with my email and password or via OAuth (Google/Facebook) so that I can access the platform as a Guest or Host to book or list properties.
Book Property:
User Story: As a Guest, I want to book a property for specific dates so that I can secure my stay at a chosen location.
Make Payment:
User Story: As a Guest, I want to make a payment for my booking using Stripe or PayPal so that I can confirm my reservation securely.
Leave Review:
User Story: As a Guest, I want to leave a rating and comment for a property after my stay so that I can share my experience with other users.
Manage System:
User Story: As an Admin, I want to monitor and manage users, listings, bookings, and payments so that I can ensure the platform operates smoothly and resolve any issues.
