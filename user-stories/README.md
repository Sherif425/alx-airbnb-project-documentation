To address the task of translating the use case diagram interactions from the previous task into user stories for the Airbnb Clone backend, I’ll convert the key use cases into user stories that capture the core interactions between actors (Guest, Host, Admin) and the system. The user stories will follow the standard format: “As a [role], I want to [action] so that [benefit].” I’ll ensure at least five user stories are created, covering major functionalities like user registration, property booking, payments, and others from the use case diagram. The output will be a Markdown file named `user-stories.md`, wrapped in an artifact tag, with instructions for storing it in the `user-stories/` directory of the `alx-airbnb-project-documentation` GitHub repository.

### Approach
- **Review Use Case Diagram**: Refer to the use case diagram from the previous response, which includes use cases like User Registration, User Login, Profile Management, Create/Update/Delete Property Listing, Search Properties, Book Property, Cancel Booking, Make Payment, Leave Review, Respond to Review, Receive Notifications, and Manage System.
- **Select Core Interactions**: Choose at least five key use cases that represent core functionalities (e.g., registration, booking, payment, review, admin management) to convert into user stories.
- **Write User Stories**: Create user stories for each selected use case, ensuring they are concise, specific, and aligned with the roles (Guest, Host, Admin).
- **Document**: Generate a Markdown file with the user stories and GitHub commit instructions.
- **GitHub Instructions**: Provide steps to create the `user-stories/` directory, save the file, and commit to the repository.

### User Stories
Based on the use case diagram, I’ll select the following core use cases to convert into user stories: User Registration, Book Property, Make Payment, Leave Review, and Manage System. These cover key interactions across Guest, Host, and Admin roles.

1. **User Registration**:
   - **User Story**: As a new user, I want to register an account with my email and password or via OAuth (Google/Facebook) so that I can access the platform as a Guest or Host to book or list properties.
2. **Book Property**:
   - **User Story**: As a Guest, I want to book a property for specific dates so that I can secure my stay at a chosen location.
3. **Make Payment**:
   - **User Story**: As a Guest, I want to make a payment for my booking using Stripe or PayPal so that I can confirm my reservation securely.
4. **Leave Review**:
   - **User Story**: As a Guest, I want to leave a rating and comment for a property after my stay so that I can share my experience with other users.
5. **Manage System**:
   - **User Story**: As an Admin, I want to monitor and manage users, listings, bookings, and payments so that I can ensure the platform operates smoothly and resolve any issues.

### Document Content
The Markdown file will list the user stories and include instructions for saving and committing to the GitHub repository.



# Airbnb Clone User Stories

## Objective
This document translates key interactions from the Airbnb Clone backend use case diagram into user stories, capturing the core functionalities for Guests, Hosts, and Admins. The user stories follow the format: “As a [role], I want to [action] so that [benefit].”

2. **Book Property**
   - **As a Guest**, I want to book a property for specific dates so that I can secure my stay at a chosen location.

3. **Make Payment**
   - **As a Guest**, I want to make a payment for my booking using Stripe or PayPal so that I can confirm my reservation securely.

4. **Leave Review**
   - **As a Guest**, I want to leave a rating and comment for a property after my stay so that I can share my experience with other users.

5. **Manage System**
   - **As an Admin**, I want to monitor and manage users, listings, bookings, and payments so that I can ensure the platform operates smoothly and resolve any issues.

## Additional Notes
- These user stories cover core interactions from the use case diagram, including registration, booking, payment, review, and admin management.
- Additional user stories (e.g., for Host actions like creating listings or responding to reviews) can be added if needed to cover all use cases.
