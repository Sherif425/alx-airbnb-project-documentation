Airbnb Clone Backend Features and Functionalities
Objective
This document outlines the key features and functionalities required for the backend of the Airbnb Clone project, as specified in the project requirements. It covers core functionalities, technical requirements, and non-functional requirements to ensure a scalable, secure, and robust system. A diagram illustrates the backend architecture, including components and their interactions.
Core Functionalities
1. User Management

User Registration:
Users can sign up as guests or hosts using email and password.
Secure authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Support OAuth for Google and Facebook login.


User Login and Authentication:
Login via email and password.
Token-based session management with JWT.


Profile Management:
Users can update profile details (e.g., name, contact info, profile photo).
Store preferences (e.g., language, currency).



2. Property Listings Management

Add Listings:
Hosts create listings with details: title, description, location, price per night, amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool), and availability.


Edit/Delete Listings:
Hosts can update or delete their listings.
Ensure only the owning host can modify/delete their listings.



3. Search and Filtering

Search Functionality:
Search properties by location, price range, number of guests, and amenities.
Implement pagination to handle large datasets efficiently.


Filtering:
Allow filtering based on specific criteria (e.g., pet-friendly, pool availability).



4. Booking Management

Booking Creation:
Guests book properties for specific dates.
Prevent double bookings by validating date availability.


Booking Cancellation:
Guests and hosts can cancel bookings per the cancellation policy.


Booking Status:
Track statuses: pending, confirmed, canceled, completed.



5. Payment Integration

Secure Payments:
Integrate with Stripe and PayPal for guest payments.
Handle automatic payouts to hosts post-booking.


Multi-Currency Support:
Allow transactions in multiple currencies.



6. Reviews and Ratings

Guest Reviews:
Guests leave ratings (1-5) and comments for properties after their stay.


Host Responses:
Hosts can respond to reviews.


Validation:
Ensure reviews are linked to completed bookings to prevent abuse.



7. Notifications System

Email and In-App Notifications:
Send notifications for booking confirmations, cancellations, and payment updates.
Use services like SendGrid or Mailgun for email delivery.



8. Admin Dashboard

Admin Interface:
Monitor and manage users, listings, bookings, and payments.
Provide analytics (e.g., booking trends, revenue).



Technical Requirements
1. Database Management

Relational Database:
Use PostgreSQL for robust relational data management.
Tables:
Users: Store user details (user_id, email, password_hash, role, etc.).
Properties: Store listing details (property_id, host_id, name, price, etc.).
Bookings: Track bookings (booking_id, user_id, property_id, dates, status).
Payments: Record payment details (payment_id, booking_id, amount, method).
Reviews: Store reviews (review_id, property_id, user_id, rating, comment).
Messages: Store communication (message_id, sender_id, recipient_id, body).





2. API Development

RESTful APIs:
Expose endpoints for all functionalities (e.g., /users, /properties, /bookings).
Use HTTP methods: GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT/PATCH (update), DELETE (remove).
Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).


Optional GraphQL:
Support complex queries for efficient data fetching (e.g., nested property and review data).



3. Authentication and Authorization

JWT Authentication:
Generate and validate JWTs for secure user sessions.


Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Differentiate permissions for guests, hosts, and admins.
Example: Only admins can manage all users; hosts manage only their listings.



4. File Storage

Cloud Storage:
Use AWS S3 or Cloudinary to store property images and user profile photos.
Ensure secure access with signed URLs.



5. Third-Party Services

Email Services:
Integrate SendGrid or Mailgun for reliable email notifications.


Payment Gateways:
Use Stripe and PayPal APIs for payment processing.



6. Error Handling and Logging

Global Error Handling:
Implement centralized error handling for consistent API responses.
Return meaningful error messages (e.g., "Property not available").


Logging:
Log API requests, errors, and critical events for debugging and auditing.



Non-Functional Requirements
1. Scalability

Modular Architecture:
Design services (e.g., user service, booking service) to allow independent scaling.


Load Balancing:
Use load balancers for horizontal scaling to handle increased traffic.



2. Security

Data Protection:
Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords with bcrypt, payment info).


Network Security:
Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent DDoS attacks.



3. Performance Optimization

Caching:
Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., search results, property details).


Query Optimization:
Optimize database queries with indexes and avoid N+1 problems.



4. Testing

Unit and Integration Tests:
Use pytest for testing backend logic and database interactions.


API Testing:
Implement automated tests for all REST endpoints to ensure functionality.
