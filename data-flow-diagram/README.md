Airbnb Clone Data Flow Diagram
Objective
This document presents a Level-1 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the Airbnb Clone backend, illustrating how data moves through the system for core functionalities, including user management, property listings, booking, payments, reviews, notifications, and admin operations. The DFD is created using Mermaid syntax and can be imported into Draw.io for visualization and export as a PNG.
DFD Overview
The DFD maps data flows between external entities (Guest, Host, Admin, Payment Gateway, Notification Service), processes, and data stores (Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, Reviews, Messages). It covers key inputs, processes, and outputs for the backend operations.
External Entities

Guest: Interacts with the system to register, log in, search properties, book properties, make payments, and leave reviews.
Host: Interacts to register, log in, manage properties, respond to reviews, and cancel bookings.
Admin: Manages users, listings, bookings, and payments.
Payment Gateway: Processes payments (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
Notification Service: Sends email/in-app notifications (e.g., SendGrid).

Data Stores

Users: Stores user details (user_id, email, role, etc.).
Properties: Stores property details (property_id, name, price, etc.).
Bookings: Stores booking details (booking_id, user_id, property_id, dates, status).
Payments: Stores payment details (payment_id, booking_id, amount, method).
Reviews: Stores review details (review_id, property_id, rating, comment).
Messages: Stores communication (message_id, sender_id, recipient_id, body).

Processes

Register/Login User: Handles user registration and authentication.
Manage Profile: Updates user profile details.
Manage Properties: Creates, updates, or deletes property listings.
Search Properties: Searches and filters properties based on criteria.
Process Booking: Creates and validates bookings.
Handle Payment: Processes payments via external gateways.
Manage Reviews: Handles guest reviews and host responses.
Send Notifications: Sends email/in-app notifications.
Admin Management: Manages users, listings, bookings, and payments.

Diagram Explanation

External Entities: Guest, Host, Admin interact with processes; Payment Gateway and Notification Service handle external integrations.
Data Stores: Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, Reviews, and Messages store persistent data, aligned with the database schema.
Processes: Each process (e.g., Process Booking, Handle Payment) represents a core functionality, receiving inputs (e.g., booking request) and producing outputs (e.g., booking confirmation).
Data Flows:
Guest submits user details to Register/Login User, which stores data in Users.
Guest searches properties, retrieving data from Properties.
Booking requests flow to Process Booking, storing data in Bookings and triggering notifications.
Payments are processed via Handle Payment, interacting with Payment Gateway and storing in Payments.
Reviews are managed, stored in Reviews, and trigger notifications.
Admin Management accesses all data stores for oversight.
Messages are stored in Messages and trigger notifications.


Notifications: The Send Notifications process integrates with the Notification Service to deliver email/in-app notifications to Guest and Host.

Instructions for Diagram Export and GitHub Commit

Import into Draw.io:
Copy the Mermaid code above.
Open Draw.io.
Go to Arrange > Insert > Advanced > Mermaid.
Paste the Mermaid code and click Insert.
Adjust styling if needed (e.g., colors, layout).


Export as PNG:
Go to File > Export as > PNG.
Save the file as data-flow.png.

Conclusion
The Level-1 DFD captures the data flow for the Airbnb Clone backend, illustrating how data moves between external entities (Guest, Host, Admin, Payment Gateway, Notification Service), processes, and data stores (Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, Reviews, Messages). The Mermaid code can be rendered in Draw.io to generate a visual diagram, exported as data-flow.png, and committed to the data-flow-diagram/ directory in the alx-airbnb-project-documentation repository.
